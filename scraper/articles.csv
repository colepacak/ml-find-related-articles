"World's Biggest Hedge Fund: ""We Are Bearish On Almost All Financial Assets""",2018-06-06T00:44:00+00:00,"One month ago, in a surprising reversal, we reported that Bridgewater was outperforming peers this year even after losing money in April,  largely as a result of a a massive derisking , i.e. turning bearish. As  Bloomberg further added , ""the fund has also reduced its net long bets on U.S. equities to about 10 percent of assets from 120% earlier this year, and that overall, the fund is net short equities.""  And now we know why.  In one of Bridgewater's latest Daily Observations authored by co-CIO Greg Jensen, the firm writes that "" 2019 is setting up to be a dangerous year, as the fiscal stimulus rolls off while the impact of the Fed's tightening will be peaking "" a point echoed yesterday by the head of the Indian central bank, Urjit Patel,  who warned  that unless the Fed ends its balance sheet reduction which comes as a time when the Treasury is soaking up dollar liquidity by issuing substantial amounts of Treasuries to fund the Trump budget, the tightening in financial conditions could lead to a global conflagration started by emerging markets.   And since asset markets lead the economy, Bridgewater continues, "" for investors the danger is already here "" and explains as follows:   Markets are already vulnerable, as the Fed is pulling back liquidity and raising rates, making cash scarcer and more attractive - reversing the easy liquidity and 0% cash rate that helped push money out of the risk curve over the course of the expansion.  The danger to assets from the shift in liquidity and the building late-cycle dynamics is compounded by the fact that financial assets are pricing in a Goldilocks scenario of sustained strength, with little chance of either a slump or an overheating as the Fed continues its tightening cycle over the next year and a half.   To justify his point, Jensen notes that markets are pricing in that the world is pricing in a ""goldilocks"" world at the start of 2020, with 2.4% growth, 3.0% 10Y yields and 2.8% Fed Funds rates, which is essentially ""an extrapolation of current conditions, with expected growth and inflation near perfect levels. The yield curve is priced to be flat, oil to be at $62, and the dollar to be down 3.5% against developed world currencies.""  Looking at pricing dynamics, the world's largest hedge fund also notes that ""expectations are for inflation to remain at fairly benign levels just above the Fed's 2% target, and options pricing reflects little investor demand for protection against the potential for the economy to bubble over. On the other hand,  it also shows virtually no chance of deflation, which is a high likelihood in the next downturn. ""  Needless to say, Bridgewater is skeptical: "" we doubt this picture of calm priced into markets will actually play out. ""  But what is most ominous, is Bridgewater's forecast beyond the end of 2019, when mysteriously most other permabullish projections are cut off. As Jansen writes, ""while such strong conditions would call for further Fed tightening, there's almost no further tightening priced in beyond the end of 2019. Bond yields are not priced in to rise much, implying that the yield curve will continue to flatten. This seems to imply an unsustainable set of conditions, given that government deficits will continue growing even after the peak of fiscal stimulation and the Fed is scheduled to continue unwinding is balance sheet, it is difficult to imagine attracting sufficient bond buyers with the yield curve continuing to flatten.""  With all of the above in mind, Bridgewater has one simple message: sold to you.   ""We are bearish on financial assets as the US economy progresses toward the late cycle, liquidity has been removed, and the markets are pricing in a continuation of recent conditions despite the changing backdrop.""   Don't worry though: Dennis Gartman remains bullish. "
"US Job Openings Hit Record High, Exceed Number Of Unemployed Workers",2018-06-05T14:30:11+00:00,"Two months after the number of US job openings reported by the JOLTS unexpectedly dropped by 150,000 led by food service and construction workers, all it took was two months of revised data to set the seasonally-adjusted, statistically inferred US labor market back on track, and according to the latest JOLTS report,  in April the number of job openings soared to a new all time high, rising by 65,000 to a record 6.698 million , the highest number of vacant jobs on record...   ... for the third consecutive month surpassing the total number of unemployed Americans,  meaning that if the job openings and unemployed job searchers were properly aligned, the US would have no unemployment.   The number of job openings increased in durable goods manufacturing (+33,000) and information (+26,000) but decreased in finance and insurance (-84,000). The number of job openings was little changed across all four geographic regions.  Adding to the exuberant picture, while job openings jumped, the number of total hires also increased to just shy of cycle higher, rising to 5.578 million in April from 5.486 million in March. The number of hires was little changed at 5.6 million in April. The hires rate was 3.8 percent. Hires for total private and for government were little changed.   Meanwhile, that other closely watched category, the level of quits - which indicates workers' confidence they can leverage their existing skills and find a better paying job - posted a modest drop, and in April declined to 3.351 million from 3.387 million. The number of quits was little changed for total private and increased for government (+17,000). Quits increased in state and local government education (+14,000) but decreased in arts, entertainment, and recreation (-25,000). The number of quits was little changed in all four regions.   And with a total 5.4 million separations (a 3.6% rate), this means that there were 1.7 million layoffs and discharges in April, 100,000 higher than in March. he layoffs and discharges rate increased to 1.2 percent over the month. The number of layoffs and discharges edged up for total private and was little changed for government. Layoffs and discharges increased in arts, entertainment, and recreation (+51,000) and in finance and insurance (+27,000). The number of layoffs and discharges was little changed in all four regions.  Putting all this in in context  Job openings have increased since a low in July 2009. They returned to the prerecession level in March 2014 and surpassed the prerecession peak in August 2014. There were 6.7 million open jobs on the last business day of April 2018, a new series high. 	 Hires have increased since a low in June 2009 and have surpassed prerecession levels. In April 2018, there were 5.6 million hires. 	 Quits have increased since a low in September 2009 and have surpassed prerecession levels. In April 2018, there were 3.4 million quits. 	 For most of the JOLTS history, the number of hires (measured throughout the month) has exceeded the number of job openings (measured only on the last business day of the month). Since January 2015, however, this relationship has reversed with job openings outnumbering hires in most months. 	 At the end of the most recent recession in June 2009, there were 1.2 million more hires throughout the month than there were job openings on the last business day of the month. In April 2018, there were 1.1 million fewer hires than job openings.   Finally, and perhaps most notably, the Beveridge Curve (job openings rate vs unemployment rate), continues to gradually normalize after a nearly decade-long ""drift"" from its conventional pattern. From the start of the most recent recession in December 2007 through the end of 2009, the series trended lower and further to the right as the job openings rate declined and the unemployment rate rose.  In April 2018, the unemployment rate was 3.9 percent and the job openings rate was 4.3 percent.
